Hi! I'm Serena. My experience with web development primarily comes from building and prototyping hackathon projects (check them out on my [github](https://github.com/sardinachanx)), and I've done projects in JavaScript-based stacks as well as Django, using both SQL and noSQL databases. My focus has primarily been on networking/systems, and I primarily work on back-end infrastructure.
